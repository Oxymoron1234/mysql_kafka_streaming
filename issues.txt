issue faced
1. In confluent kafka we can not specify decimal or timestamp type of datatype data, we can only use premetived datatype so used float for price and string for updated_timestamp
2. If we want to use multi-threads to execute 5 diff consumers at the same time we cant if we close the connection in finally as it will hamper the execution of other thread so close it in main thread
